# Chess Opening Database
### Summary
This is an application for chess players who want to keep track and expand of their opening repertoire for chess.
As amateur chess player myself, I have trouble memorizing certain lines so this type of database would be helpful. 
This program would allow you to input openings, save them, and view all the openings you have saved from a
 user-friendly interface.
### User Stories
As a user, I want to be able to
 - view all openings stored in the database
 - add openings
 - add alternative lines
 - delete openings
 - export and import openings via PGN
